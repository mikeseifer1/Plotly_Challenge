# Plotly_Challenge
launch from the index.html file.
Included in the repository is the samples.json file which contains the data and the app.js file which contains all the scrips to create the graphs on the html page.

The code for the bonus section of the homework was included in the first section of the code because it uses a value from the metadata and I therefore did not have to recreate the code towards the bottom of the file. The other two graphs take data from the samples section of the data so they are in the next section of code.
